### Hi, Iâ€™m Peter

I'm an astrophysics student at Saint Mary's University. I mostly work on globular clusters, specifically on fitting [dynamical models](https://github.com/mgieles/limepy) to observations in order to figure out their black hole content. More generally, I'm interested in the dynamics and substructure of the Milky Way galaxy.
