### Hi, Iâ€™m Peter

I'm a PhD student at the Max Planck Insitute for Astronomy in Heidelberg. I work on the internal dynamics of globular clusters, specifically on fitting [dynamical models](https://github.com/mgieles/limepy) to observations to figure out their black hole content. More generally, I'm interested in the dynamics and substructure of the Milky Way galaxy.
